<p>Tirupati is a major Hindu pilgrimage site and is home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, a self-manifested temple dedicated to Vishnu. The temple is located on the sacred hill of Tirumala, which is considered so holy that non-Hindus were not allowed to ascend it before 1870. </p>
<p>Tirupati is known as the abode of the Hindu god Venkateshvara, Lord of Seven Hills. The sacred hill of Tirumala is situated about 6 miles (10 km) northwest of Tirupati in Sri Venkateshwara Sanctuary and National Park. The hill was considered so holy that before 1870 non-Hindus were not permitted to ascend it.</p>
